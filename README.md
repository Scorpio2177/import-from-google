[Cozy](http://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you
with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one
profiles you. You install only the applications you want. You can build your
own one too.

## Contribute with Transifex

Transifex can be used the same way as git. It can push or pull translations. The config file in the .tx repository configure the way Transifex is working : it will get the json files from the locales repository.
If you want to learn more about how to use this tool, I'll invite you to check [this](http://docs.transifex.com/introduction/) tutorial.
